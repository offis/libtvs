# Timed-Value Streams

[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/offis/libtvs.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/offis/libtvs)

The *Timed Value Stream Library* provides an advanced framework for
instrumentation, pre-processing and recording of functional and extra-functional
properties in SystemC-based virtual prototyping simulations.

This repository contains an implementation of the library described in the paper
*Advanced SystemC Tracing and Analysis Framework for Extra-Functional
Properties*, Philipp A. Hartmann, Kim GrÃ¼ttner, and Wolfgang Nebel, Procceedings
of the 11th International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing
(ARC'15).

## Abstract

System-level simulations are an important part in the design flow for today's
complex systems-on-a-chip.  Trade-off analysis during architectural exploration
as well as run-time reconfiguration of applications and their mapping require
detailed introspection of the dynamic effects on the target platform.
Additionally, extra-functional properties like power consumption and performance
characteristics are important metrics to assess the quality of a design.  In
this paper, we present an advanced framework for instrumentation, pre-processing
and recording of functional and extra-functional properties in SystemC-based
virtual prototyping simulations.  The framework is based on a hierarchy of
so-called timed value streams, allowing to address the requirements for highly
configurable, dynamic architectures while allowing tailored introspection of the
required system characteristics under analysis.

## Build System and Dependencies

The library requires the build system ``CMake >= 3.7``.

### Library Dependencies

The library requires a compiler with C++11 support. It was successfully tested
with the following toolchains:

- ``gcc-5``, ``gcc-6``, ``gcc-7``
- ``clang-3.8``, ``clang-5.0``, ``clang-6.0``

External dependencies:

- `SystemC >= 2.3.2`  (optional, default=yes)
- `boost >= 1.51`

### Building the Library

To build the library, create a build directory and run ``cmake`` in the new
directory while pointing it to the source directory.  Assuming you have
cloned/extracted the repository in ``$PWD``, you can use the following commands
to generate the build files:

    $ mkdir -p build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..

After that, the library can be built using:

    $ cmake --build .

## Build Options

You can use ``cmake -L`` in the build directory to get a list of all build
settings.  Another way to browse and change the settings in an existing build
directory is ``ccmake``.

Build options can be set when creating the build system, e.g.:

    $ cmake .. -D<var>=<value>

Refer to the CMake documentation ``cmake(1)`` for a more detailed description on
how to set options.

## SystemC Dependency

If a SystemC build is requested (by default), the CMake will search for a
suitable SystemC library via the internal ``find_package`` mechanism.
Therefore, SystemC needs to be installed with ``cmake`` support, which is
available starting at SystemC version 2.3.2.  See `cmake-packages(7)` for more
information.

Building with SystemC support enables the Timed-Value Streams to be integrated
into the the SystemC module hierarchy.  Furthermore, the library will use the
SystemC time type as its default unit.  Streams will be created as ``sc_object``
instances within the module hierarchy.  The interface of a ``timed_value`` will
internally use the ``sc_core::sc_time`` datatype for time and duration storage
and provide conversion operators for ``boost::units``.

If built without SystemC support, the library will use the `boost::units`
datatypes for representing time durations and it will use its own, minimal
object registry for supporting name-based stream binding.

## Test Suite and Documentation

By default, a test suite is built which contains unit tests and example files.
The unit tests require the Google Test framework ``gtest``.  If `gtest` is not
available on your system, the build system will automatically download and
compile the dependency.  The build option `TVS_ENABLE_TESTS` controls if the
test suite should be built.

``TVS_ENABLE_DOCS`` enables generating the preliminary documentation using
Doxygen.
