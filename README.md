# Timed-Value Streams

[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/offis/libtvs.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/offis/libtvs)

The *Timed Value Stream Library* provides an advanced framework for
instrumentation, pre-processing and recording of functional and extra-functional
properties in SystemC-based virtual prototyping simulations.

This repository contains an implementation of the library described in the paper
*Advanced SystemC Tracing and Analysis Framework for Extra-Functional
Properties*, Philipp A. Hartmann, Kim GrÃ¼ttner, and Wolfgang Nebel, Procceedings
of the 11th International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing
(ARC'15).

## Abstract

System-level simulations are an important part in the design flow for today's
complex systems-on-a-chip.  Trade-off analysis during architectural exploration
as well as run-time reconfiguration of applications and their mapping require
detailed introspection of the dynamic effects on the target platform.
Additionally, extra-functional properties like power consumption and performance
characteristics are important metrics to assess the quality of a design.  In
this paper, we present an advanced framework for instrumentation, pre-processing
and recording of functional and extra-functional properties in SystemC-based
virtual prototyping simulations.  The framework is based on a hierarchy of
so-called timed value streams, allowing to address the requirements for highly
configurable, dynamic architectures while allowing tailored introspection of the
required system characteristics under analysis.

## Build System and Dependencies

The library requires the build system ``meson >= 0.39``.  By default, meson uses
the `ninja` backend to generate the build instructions.  On debian-based
systems, you can install ninja via

    $ sudo apt-get install ninja-build

If ``meson`` is not available via your distribution package manager, you can
install it via `pip` (specifically, the python3 `pip` variant):

    $ pip3 install meson
    
Alternatively, you can download the archive or check out the sources from
https://github.org/mesonbuild/meson and use `meson.py` directly.  Refer to the
`meson` website at http://mesonbuild.com/ for more information.

### Library Dependencies

The library requires a compiler with C++11 support.  It was successfully tested
with ``gcc 6.3`` and ``clang 6.0``.
  
External dependencies:

- `SystemC >= 2.3.2`  (optional, default=yes)
- `boost >= 1.51`

### Building the Library

To build the library, create a build directory and run `meson` in the new
directory while pointing it to the source directory:

    $ cd <path/to/libtvs>
    $ mkdir objdir
    $ cd objdir
    $ meson ..

After configuring the build directory, you can run the build using ``ninja``.
``ninja test`` will run the test suite.
    
## Build Options

The library-specific build options can be queried using ``meson configure``.

You can either directly specify the build options when configuring the build
directory using ``meson -D<name>=<value> <...>`` or use ``mesonconf
-D<name>=<value>`` after having configured the directory.  You can also use
``mesonconf`` to inspect all available build configuration options.

## SystemC Dependency
    
If a SystemC build is requested, the build system will search for a suitable
SystemC library via `pkg-config`.  If a `pkg-config` file is not available, you
can optionally specify custom SystemC library and include header paths via the
options `-Dsc_includedir` and `-Dsc_libdir`:

    $ mkdir objdir
    $ cd objdir
    $ meson -Dsc_libdir=/opt/systemc-2.3.1/lib-linux64 \
          -Dsc_includedir=/opt/systemc-2.3.1/include ..
          
Building with SystemC support enables re-use of the SystemC module hierarchy and
data types.  Streams will be created as ``sc_object`` instances within the
module hierarchy.  The interface of a ``timed_value`` will also internally use
the ``sc_core::sc_time`` datatype for time and duration storage and provide
conversion operators for ``boost::units``.

## Test Suite and Documentation
          
By default, a test suite is built which contains unit tests and example files.
The unit tests require the Google Test framework ``gtest``.  If `gtest` is not
available on your system, `meson` will download and compile the dependency
automatically.  The build option `enable_tests` controls if the test suite
should be built.

To enable generating the preliminary documentation using Doxygen, set
``enable_docs`` to true:

    $ mesonconf -Denable_docs=true
    $ ninja
